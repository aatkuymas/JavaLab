lab1:
1. **Code 1 (Lab1)**: This code is for validating a credit card number. It performs multi-step validation, checking length, reversing the number, doubling digits in odd positions, summing them, and applying a checksum to determine if the card number is valid.

2. **Code 2 (Lab1b)**: This code is a game that assigns points to specific letters in one or two words, calculates scores for each side (left and right), and declares a winner based on which side has the higher total score. It allows for either a single word or a competition between two words.Yes, there are two codes. Hereâ€™s a brief summary for each:

lab2:

1. **Code 1 (Lab2a)**: This program finds the `k` most frequent elements in an array. It first calculates the frequency of each element, sorts them by frequency (and by element value for ties), and then displays the top `k` unique elements based on these frequencies.

2. **Code 2 (ShareTrader)**: This program calculates the maximum profit a trader can make from stock prices, given at different times, allowing at most two transactions. It uses arrays to store profits for each potential buy-sell pair, calculates the maximum profit for each day, and then combines results to determine the highest possible profit.

lab3:
This Java code  defines a base class Employee with attributes and methods for employee details and bonus calculation, which can be overridden by derived classes. The derived classes HourlyEmployee, SalariedEmployee, and ExecutiveEmployee represent different types of employees, each with specific salary calculations and bonus structures. The Lab3 class serves as the main entry point, where instances of these employee types are created and their information is displayed, showcasing  inheritance in action.
